## General Approach

### System design interviews can be of 3 types
1. Open Ended Service (Uber, Facebook, Whatsapp, TinyURL)
2. Specific System (Load Balancer, API Rate Limiter, Task Scheduler)
3. Object Oriented Design (Chess, Parking lot)

### Approach for open ended systems
1. F -> Define 2-3 core features (FEAT)
2. U -> Use Cases
3. S -> What to Store (not the DB model)
4. H -> Hight Level Design
5. D -> Detailed Design
